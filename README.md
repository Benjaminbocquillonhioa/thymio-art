# thymio-art
Swarms of physical Thymio II robots performing different tasks.

This internship aims to explore the field of Artificial Intelligence in the context of Swarm Robotics. Therefore, one of my goals is to provide experimental set-up with robots for further research into the adaption in complex tasks and complex environments for robots.
