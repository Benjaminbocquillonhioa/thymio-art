# thymio-art
Swarms of physical Thymio II robots performing different tasks.

This project aims to explore the field of Artificial Intelligence in the context of Swarm Robotics. Therefore, one of my goals is to provide experimental set-up with robots for further research into the adaption in complex tasks and complex environments for robots.
You can fin the guide to link your robot to the Raspberry Pi with all the settings, codes I used in Python and Aseba for my researches and patterns for Raspberry Pi case using 3D printers.
